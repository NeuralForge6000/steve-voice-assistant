# Security Policy

## 🔒 Security Features

Steve Voice Assistant is designed with security as a primary concern. This document outlines our security measures and how to report security vulnerabilities.

## 🛡️ Built-in Security Protections

### 1. **Input Sanitization & Prompt Injection Protection**
- Advanced pattern detection for malicious input
- Content filtering for HTML/XML tags and dangerous phrases
- Input length limitations to prevent abuse
- Real-time sanitization with security event logging

### 2. **Data Encryption & Privacy**
- **Conversation History**: Encrypted using Fernet symmetric encryption
- **Temporary Files**: Secure creation with owner-only permissions
- **Secure Deletion**: Audio files overwritten with random data before deletion
- **Memory Protection**: Sensitive data cleared from memory on cleanup

### 3. **Resource Protection**
- **System Monitoring**: Real-time disk space and memory usage tracking
- **Rate Limiting**: Configurable API call limits (daily/hourly)
- **Cost Controls**: Session cost limits with automatic enforcement
- **Resource Limits**: Configurable thresholds for system resources

### 4. **Audit & Monitoring**
- **Security Logging**: Comprehensive audit trail of security events
- **Error Handling**: Secure error messages without information disclosure
- **Usage Tracking**: Detailed monitoring of API usage and costs
- **Event Correlation**: Security events logged with timestamps and context

## 🔧 Security Configuration

### Recommended Security Settings

```python
# High Security Configuration
assistant.ENABLE_HISTORY = False           # Disable history for maximum privacy
assistant.MAX_DAILY_API_CALLS = 50         # Conservative API limits
assistant.MAX_SESSION_COST = 1.00          # Low cost threshold
assistant.COST_WARNING_THRESHOLD = 0.25    # Early warning
assistant.MIN_DISK_SPACE_MB = 500          # Ensure adequate storage
assistant.MAX_MEMORY_PERCENT = 75          # Conservative memory usage
```

### Environment Security

```bash
# Secure API key storage
export GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY="your_key_here"

# Restrict file permissions
chmod 600 .env
chmod 700 steve_security_*.log
```

## 🚨 Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please follow responsible disclosure:

### 📧 Contact Information
- **Email**: neuralforge6000[@]gmail[.]com
- **Subject**: "SECURITY: [Brief Description]"

### 📋 What to Include
1. **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
2. **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed reproduction steps
3. **Impact Assessment**: Potential security impact
4. **Suggested Fix**: If you have recommendations
5. **Your Contact Info**: For follow-up questions

### ⏱️ Response Timeline
- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 1 week
- **Resolution Target**: Within 30 days (depending on severity)

### 🏆 Recognition
We believe in recognizing security researchers who help improve our security:
- Security researchers will be credited in our security acknowledgments
- We maintain a responsible disclosure policy
- No bug bounty program currently, but we appreciate responsible disclosure

## ⚠️ Security Considerations for Users

### 🔐 API Key Security
- **Never commit API keys** to version control
- **Use environment variables** for sensitive data
- **Rotate keys regularly** if possible
- **Monitor API usage** for unexpected activity

### 🎙️ Voice Data Privacy
- **Local Processing**: Voice data processed locally when possible
- **Temporary Storage**: Audio files automatically deleted after processing
- **Conversation History**: Encrypted and can be disabled
- **No Cloud Storage**: Voice recordings not stored in cloud services

### 🖥️ System Security
- **Run with least privilege** when possible
- **Monitor resource usage** for unusual activity
- **Keep dependencies updated** regularly
- **Review security logs** periodically

### 🌐 Network Security
- **HTTPS Only**: All API communications use HTTPS
- **Certificate Validation**: TLS certificates properly validated
- **No Local Network Exposure**: No network services exposed locally
- **API Rate Limiting**: Built-in protection against abuse

## 📊 Security Monitoring

### 🔍 What We Log
- Authentication attempts and API key usage
- Input sanitization events and potential injection attempts
- Resource usage patterns and limit violations
- File access patterns and security-relevant operations
- Error conditions that might indicate security issues

### 📈 Security Metrics
- Daily API call patterns
- Resource usage trends
- Error rate monitoring
- Security event frequency

## 🔄 Security Updates

### 📦 Dependency Management
- Regular security audits of dependencies
- Automated vulnerability scanning
- Prompt updates for security patches
- Clear communication about security updates

### 🆕 Version Security
- **Security patches** released as needed
- **Version numbering** indicates security updates
- **Change logs** include security improvements
- **Migration guides** for security-related changes

## 🧪 Security Testing

### 🔬 Testing Methodology
- Input validation testing with malicious payloads
